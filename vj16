            <p>In my restless dreams,
                I see that town.
                
                Silent Hill.
                
                You promised me you'd take me
                there again someday.
                But you never did.
                
                Well, I'm alone there now...
                In our 'special place'...
                Waiting for you...
                
                Waiting for you to
                come to see me.
                
                But you never do.
                
                And so I wait, wrapped in my
                cocoon of pain and loneliness.
                
                I know I've done a terrible
                thing to you. Something you'll
                never forgive me for.
                
                I wish I could change
                that, but I can't.
                
                I feel so pathetic and ugly
                laying here, waiting for you...
                
                Every day I stare up at the cracks
                in the ceiling and all I can think
                about is how unfair it all is...
                
                The doctor came today.
                He told me I could go
                home for a short stay.
                
                It’s not that I'm getting better.
                It’s just that this may be
                my last chance...
                
                I think you know what I mean...
                
                Even so, I'm glad to be coming
                home. I've missed you terribly.
                
                But I'm afraid, James.
                I'm afraid you don't really
                want me to come home.
                
                Whenever you come see me,
                I can tell how hard it is on you...
                
                I don't know if you
                hate me or pity me...
                Or maybe I just disgust you...
                
                I'm sorry about that.
                
                When I first learned that
                I was going to die, I just
                didn't want to accept it.
                
                I was so angry all the time and I
                struck out at everyone I loved most.
                Especially you, James.
                
                That's why I understand
                if you do hate me.
                
                But I want you to
                know this, James.
                
                I'll always love you.
                
                Even though our life together had
                to end like this, I still wouldn't
                trade it for the world. We had
                some wonderful years together.
                
                Well, this letter has gone on
                too long, so I'll say goodbye.
                
                I told the nurse to give
                this to you after I'm gone.
                
                That means that as you read
                this, I'm already dead.
                
                I can't tell you to remember me,
                but I can't bear for you to
                forget me.
                
                These last few years since I
                became ill... I'm so sorry for
                what I did to you, did to us...
                
                You've given me so much and
                I haven't been able to return
                a single thing.
                
                That's why I want you to live
                for yourself now.
                Do what's best for you, James.
                
                James...
                
                You made me happy.</p>
